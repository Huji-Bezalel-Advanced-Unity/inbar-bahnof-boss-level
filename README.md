### Story
We are flowers that grow in the garden, humans want to pick us. The boss battle serves as a confrontation between the flowers and the human who seeks to harvest them. This highlights the theme of nature versus human intervention, with the player fighting to protect their home and fellow flowers from being picked.

### Boss
- **Appearance:** A human hand that wants to pick the flower, trying to hold us and cut the stem.
- **Attacks:**
  - Throws poison to kill/weaken us.
  - Uses garden tools such as a trowel to create holes in the ground and disturb the player.

### Player Mechanics
- **Escape:** If the boss holds the player, the player needs to poke it with a thorn.
- **Movement:** Flower needs an amount of water to keep moving and stay alive, or to move at a normal pace.
- **Defense:** Can use a petal shield to protect itself from poison.
- **Attack:** Throws seed/pollen bombs at the human to keep him away.
- **Resource Collection:** Collects sunlight for an energy boost.
